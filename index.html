  <h1 class="title">How Did My Relationship With Ms. Weksler Come to Be?</h1>
  <hr>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p class="text">When I first stepped into Marlboro High School freshman year, I really didn't know what to expect. I was that typical scared, little freshman trying to navigate the hallways not knowing the types of people who were going to be in my classes or even what types of teachers that I would be confronted with. When it came to the time to step into Ms. Weksler’s room on the first day of school, I immediately had that feeling of welcomeness and comfortness as I was adjusting to my new classmates for English that year. I had this feeling inside that I knew I would be able to gain a strong bond with a woman like her even after being in the classroom for one block. Throughout my freshman year, I was very quiet and intimidated when it came to a lot of my teachers, and unexpectedly it was like this with Ms. Weksler, I was never as open as I wished I would be around her and was constantly anxious in class. However, even though she knew I was nervous to be in the environment I was in, she would still check up on me and make sure I was doing okay, which made an everlasting impact on myself. Once COVID-19 had hit during March 2020, I left freshman year English class with a regret that I had never really opened up to her about much when she was always there for me. I was so lucky that year that I had a teacher who really cared about me and the rest of her students, always willing to do anything to make us feel nothing but comfort when walking into her classroom everyday. Luckily, I was able to have another opportunity sophomore year, by having a second year of being her student again. </p>

  <h1 class="title">What Was My Experience Like During Sophomore Year (Year 2) With Ms. Weksler?</h1>
  <hr>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p class="text">During my sophomore year of High School, it was evident there was a shift in the environment of school. Through COVID, there was a transition from in person schooling to remote learning, which had a major impact on myself to a mental health extent and evidently to other teachers as well. From a student perspective, I had always enjoyed English class last year mainly because Ms. Weksler would always try to make it fun… even when she knew some things weren’t...and especially because of the fact that a good amount of us were so unmotivated by being at home. The countless ceiling fans shown on the meet, the endless times of her saying "...turn your camera on!" in order to get my fellow classmates to cooperate, and with lack of participation and engagement from many of my classmates there was an evident difference in the way class had turned into. However, in times of trouble, this was THE class that was a turning point for me and was able to get me through the school year as I was facing multiple instances of adversity. </p>
    <p class="text">To dive deeper into more of a personal perspective… last year I unexpectedly went into a period of time where my anxiety rate was above average, I constantly thought that everyone hated me from overthinking, and that I just was not enough. Being in the environment I was in from COVID, being stuck at home, just really made everything worse for myself and gave me more of the opportunity to sit down and think much more often and these constant thoughts were in fact not positive ones. There was always a feeling of stress and anxiety going through my body at every second of every day, and I never had the chance to calm down. Going to Ms. Weksler’s class for 50 minutes out of my day gave me that chance to smile and take a deep breath, as she helped me realize that everything will be okay in the end and that I just need to live my life. As we moved through the school year, the option of going into high school in person became available and of course this was something I had chose to do, since being around all of my friends and others just made me so happy when I was constantly feeling lonely. </p>
    <p class="text">When I was in English class, Ms. Weksler always used to ask about how I was doing and how my family was every once in a while, and it meant the world to me, since during the time I really didn’t think anyone had cared. This demonstrates the idea that small actions or words really go a long way for some individuals and make the biggest impact which typically, one does not realize. Her ability to constantly make me laugh and smile when no one else really could and overall just helping me to enjoy living in the moment had helped me more than expected. </p>
    <p class="text">Throughout sophomore year, going through my own mental troubles, I realized how significant of a figure Ms. Weksler truly is in my life, and I do not know where I would be without her today. I continue to always thank her so much for her continual presence in my life, and for always being that guide and support that I still will need sometimes. It is really a relief to know that I will always have Ms. Weksler as a significant individual that is fortunately still apart of my life today and I will always appreciate her for the many amazing experiences she has given me during my high school years. </p>

  <h1 class="title">Why Did I Choose Ms. Weksler To Be My "Hero"/Inspiration?</h1>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p class="text">When thinking about someone that I would choose to include in my webpage, the first person that would probably typically come to mind would be one of my parents. However, I recognized how lucky I was to even have a <span class="block">teacher</span> in my life who I am always inspired by and always comfortable going to for the best advice when I sometimes feel I can’t talk to my parents about certain things. Ms. Weksler has always inspired me based on the type of person that she is. She’s strong, independent, and always caring for others, which is the type of person I would like to become as I grow older as an individual. I feel like as I was creating another webpage for this week, that it should be about a certain teacher who has made a giant impact on my life, since they are typically not appreciated as often as they should be. I am eternally grateful for Ms. Weksler and for how much I look up to her as a woman and an impactful teacher. She is one of those teachers that I will remember forever in many years going forward. </p>

  <h1 class="title">What Would I Advise Viewers To Do Based on Personal Experience?</h1>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p class="text">For anyone who views this site, I would personally advise to think about any significant figure in your life, ones who have contributed so much to your life making you feel loved and appreciated or even ones who have made the tiniest impact, and let them know you are grateful for them. Thank them for all of their constant support, guidance, and love towards you, because from what I have learned, even a few nice words go a long way for some individuals. Figures, such as Ms. Weksler for myself, that make an everlasting impact on your life, are the people you will never ever forget. Sometimes, other individuals need to be reminded that they are appreciated by many, and remind them that they are an asset in this world with their influence. </p>
